            <h1 id="myPlaylist">Recommended songs from me!</h1>
            <h2 id="description">Some of them hold memories..</h2>
            <p>Starting off strong with the most listened song : About You by The 1975. I highly recommmend this if you struggled to<br>forget someone you love in the past.</p>
            <p>Second is.. 'Cause You Have To by LANY. This song tells a story of a love relationship that is close to being done or over.<br>And, it is also because there is only one party that
            are struggling to maintain the current relationship.</p>
            <p>Now third! Another song from my favorite artist, LANY. It's named 'Alonica'. One of my most listened song.<br>
            And the reason is, because this whole song tells a story of a person's self-acceptance as part of the lesson of their life story.<br>
            This person had gone through many things in their life, until they finally made peace with reality and began to accept themself as they are. </p>
